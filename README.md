### StackOverflow Developer Survey 2018

# Analyzing Bootcamp respondants

Each year, StackOverflow asks the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences, then they publish Survey results of over 100,000 developers.

In this project I analyze bootcamp respondants and its relationships with non-bootcamp respondants.
